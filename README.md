This repository aims to be a self contained resource for understanding **diffusion** based models. It will contain implmentations from scratch of different diffusion models and is an extension of my own journey of understanding these beautiful models. It will have the resources that I found most useful in my own journey and the readily available notebooks that you can try out for yourself. 

The topics covered in this repo are - 

1. [Denosising Diffusion Probabilistic Model(DDPM)](./ddpm)
2. Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
3. Different Scheduling Algorithms
